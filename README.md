  - *Total Trips*: There were 2.34 million bike trips in the month of August in NYC. Broken down by user type, we see that most of those trips were taken by Annual Subscribers.
  - *Trips by Weekday per Hour*: Weekday evenings are the busiest times for rides.
  - *Weekly Trips by User Type*: From the week of Jul 28 to the week of Aug 4, we see a considerable increase in the number of rides by Annual Subscribers.

Gender Breakdown Visualizations [<a href="https://public.tableau.com/shared/DPNBK679K?:display_count=n&:origin=viz_share_link">Dashboard link</a>]

  - *Gender Breakdown*: The majority of rides are taken by males -- 25% are taken by Females, and for about 9% of rides, the gender is unknown.
  - *Daily Trips by Gender and User Type*: Again we see that males ride most frequently, and do so most often on weekday evenings. It also appears that more of the Short-Term Customer data is Unknown gender than Male or Female.
  - *Gender by User Type*: Digging into the user type data, we see that indeed, most of those users -- Almost 200,000 -- are Unknown gender.

  - *NYC Bike Count*: The number of unique bikes used in the NYC program in August 2019 is 13,983. 
  - *Trips by Weekday per Hour*: The early-morning hours would be ideal for repairs or maintenance, as rides are infrequent then.
  - *Trip Duration by Hour*: The majority of rides are under 40-minutes in length.


## Summary
In addition to being a convenient resource for tourists, the bike sharing program in NYC is presumably popular among locals, as riders tend to be Annual Subscribers to the program. Additionally, our review of trip start times -- which peak on weekday mornings and evenings -- suggest that bikes may be used by workday commuters. When considering the launch of a similar program in Des Moines, it will be important to review the geographical spread of commerce hubs.

Additionally, it is suggested that these results be supplemented by a comparative analysis of population data, including tourism figures and population density, between NYC and Des Moines,in order to help inform the scale of such a program in this city.
